# Service Installation Guide

## Individual Service Installation

### API Gateway Only
```bash
cd api_gateway/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Core Service Only
```bash
cd core/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Agents Service Only  
```bash
cd specialists/agents/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Memory Service Only
```bash
cd memory/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Combined Installations

### API Gateway + Core (Common setup)
```bash
pip install -r api_gateway/requirements.txt
pip install -r core/requirements.txt
```

### Core + Agents (Common for most deployments)
```bash
pip install -r core/requirements.txt
pip install -r specialists/agents/requirements.txt
```

### Full Platform (All Services)
```bash
pip install -r requirements3.txt
```

## Docker/Container Optimization

### Multi-stage Dockerfile example for API Gateway:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as api-gateway
WORKDIR /app
COPY api_gateway/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY api_gateway/ ./api_gateway/
COPY common/ ./common/
CMD ["uvicorn", "api_gateway.main:socket_app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8001"]
```

### Multi-stage Dockerfile example for Core Service:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as core-service
WORKDIR /app
COPY core/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY core/ ./core/
COPY common/ ./common/
CMD ["uvicorn", "core.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8002"]
```

### Multi-stage Dockerfile example for Agents Service:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim as agents-service
WORKDIR /app
COPY specialists/agents/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY specialists/agents/ ./specialists/agents/
CMD ["uvicorn", "specialists.agents.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8015"]
```
